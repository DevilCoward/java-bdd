Glossary of Terms
=================

### Background

Our Coding Style Guide docs enforce a rule of "no acronyms" and "declare variables with meaningful names", which we follow, for the most part, although it seems we've had exceptions for quite some time, especially for acronyms, and especially especially for acronyms which are specific to the bank -- for example, M2M, M2NM, M2C, DSK, PSK, etc.  

This Glossary of Terms serves to document and define which acronyms are permitted for use within the framework.
